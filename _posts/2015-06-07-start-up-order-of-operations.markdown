Too many times I've made the mistake of not following the right steps when designing a product. Actually let me rephrase that - too many times I've forgotten to design a product and blundered ahead with making it. Occasionally I'll do some visual art (mock ups) first and praise myself for following protocol.

The reality is that there is a butt-load of work to be done before you can decide on the shape of a button. In order for that button to accomplish your mission, your mission must be clearly defined. Otherwise that button will flail around in dissatisfaction and go work for another company with a clear mission/vision instead.

As a developer I tend to think that writing code is cheap - I am trying to unlearn this. Writing code is expensive. The initial investment is relatively cheap for me compared to non-coders. But maintaining that code to ensure it actually serves a purpose is bloody expensive for anyone, be you a designer, developer, product manager.

In order to afford to code effectively (or draw buttons) I needed to acknowledge that it is expensive and that I should conserve my resources before deploying them in a structured and intentional manner.

I submit for your consumption, and my future reference, the order of operations you should take when designing your business, your product, or your startup.

1. **Identify a problem which people have, and that you are qualified to solve.** If you are not qualified, you should have a passion to solve it and the budget to hire qualified people. Before you continue, be really sure you want to solve this problem - the vast majority of startups are defined by years of toiling in anguish not wheelbarrows full of cash.
2. **Gather feedback from potential users** and **research the many cases of others attempting to solve the same problem**. Do not be insular. People are doing you a favour by listening to your idea, thank them with cake or chocolate.
3. **Have a Mission which, when you accomplish it, solves user's problems**. Whenever you are deciding whether or not implement a feature, or make any decision, you should be able to ask yourself *Will this work to accomplish my mission?*
4. **Have a Vision which reflects the future when your mission is successful.** Is there something which is going to happen which will make your solution thrive? Will the effect of accomplishing your mission open an opportunity for you to succeed further?.
5. **Design a Solution which solves the problem.** Ensure that users know what problem you are solving for them. Ensure it *actually does* solve it for them. If you have no industry experience in design, hire or at least consult with a designer.
6. **Test that Solution to ensure it solves the problem in an elegant and unobstructive manner.** Most of all test that it *really actually does* (can't stress that enough) solve a real problem. Again, are you a designer? No? Get a designer.
7. **Develop the Solution**. The need for help in developing a scalable solution is more obvious than the need for help designing it (you can't code, don't own a manufacturing plant, etc). But give the best developers in the world bad design and you'll either get an awful product or you'll lose your developers (probably the latter - good developers know the hallmarks of bad design). This is me stressing that you ensure you are confident in your design.
8. **Test the Solution to see all the ways it *actually doesn't* solve the problem of your users (or maybe it does but it could be more elegant and unobstructive).** Go back to step 5 and follow this cycle until either you find only trivial bugs which are not worth fixing (proceed to step 9) **or** you run out of money, realise the problem isn't real, or that your solution is flawed (cut your loses and decide whether you want to go back to step 1/2/3 to relive the anguish of startups or whether you want to go get a real job again).
9. Wow you're still here? You must have made a successful product. How's that vision going? **Go back to step 1, replacing the word *'people'* with *'customers'*.**

I will refine these as I test and iterate. I invite you to do the same and share your findings below.
