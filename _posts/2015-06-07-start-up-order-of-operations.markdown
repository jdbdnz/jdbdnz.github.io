Too many times I've made the mistake of not following the right steps when designing a product. Actually let me rephrase that - too many times I've forgotten to design a start up and blundered ahead with code. Occasionally I'll do some visual art (mock ups) first and praise myself for following protocol.

The reality is that there is a butt-load of work to be done before you can decide on the shape of a button. In order for that button to accomplish your mission, your mission must be clearly defined. Unwise that button will flail around in dissatifaction and go work for another company with a clear mission/vision instead.

As a developer I tend to think that writing code is cheap - I am trying to unlearn this. Writing code is expensive. The initial investment is relatively cheap for me compared to non-coders. But maintaining that code to ensure it actually serves a purpose is bloody expensive for anyone, be you a designer, developer, or product manager.

In order to afford to code effectively (or draw buttons) I needed to acknoledge that it is expensive and that I should conserve my resources before deploying them in a structured and intentional manner.

I submit for your consumption, and my future reference, the order of operations you should take when designing your business, your product, or your startup.

1. Get a Mission
2. Get a Vision 
3. Imagine an Outcome which serves that mission and vision
4. Build a social structure which may serve that outcome 
5. Test the interactions in that structure actually DO arrive at that outcome
6. Create the damn thing
7. See where you fucked up and iterate

I will refine these as I test and iterate. I invite you to do the same and share your findings below.
