Achievements</li>
  <li>Initiated, researched and developed .NET Framework 4.0 replacement for TS3’s proprietary user interface framework ‘LUIS’ which was previously limited to .NET Framework 2.0.

This allowed responsive user interfaces to be developed, solving a major pain point for clients who were running solutions with interfaces designed for 4:3 aspect ratio monitors, but had since upgraded to widescreen monitors</li>
  <li>Developed legacy support for the new LUIS 4.0, essentially making WPF act as a wrapper to run the WinForms solutions developed for LUIS 2.0. This enabled TS3 to discontinue support for LUIS 2.0 while still continuing support for those solutions developed for LUIS 2.0, whose owners did not want to update their interfaces from WinForms to WPF</li>
  <li>Developed C# SDK for integration with ArcGIS routing system</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="technical-lead-digital-stock">Technical Lead, Digital Stock</h4>
<p><strong><em>November 2011 - November 2013</em></strong></p>

<p>I started Digital Stock with Avinash Varghese in 2011 while I was studying at the Southern Institute of Technology. We offered CMS websites and online marketing services to local businesses. I provided the technical expertise and Avinash offered business experience and strong social networks to leverage sales.</p>

<p>My purpose in founding Digital Stock was to gain industry experience and also make that opportunity available to other students. In 2012 we hired two of my classmates Jim Dowling and Will Finlayson. When I graduated I wanted to grow my skills and career by working under more senior developers, and as I left those two purchased my shares and became directors.
Digital Stock evolved rapidly and is now a busy development consultancy specializing in farming technology. I am extremely proud that Digital Stock maintains a close relationship with the Southern Institute of Technology by continuing to offer industry experience to students through internships.</p>
