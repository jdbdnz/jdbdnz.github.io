<h4 id="lead-developer-chalklecom">Lead Developer, Chalkle.com</h4>
<p><em>July 2014 — June 2015</em></p>

<p>Chalkle is a small startup, and I worked in a product team of two (myself and a developer/UX designer). I was hired on a six month contract to develop and maintain Chalkle’s web application which uses Rails 3 for front end and back.</p>

<p> When I started, Chalkle was a piecemeal MVP which has seen a great many part-time developers working on it. It needed a major overhaul and central leadership of the technical systems to bring coherency and maintainability to the code base. I worked with internal and external stakeholders to establish the functional outcomes and define scope of my contract. I succeeded in overhauling the backend by mid October, while managing continuous integration and multiple releases each week without significantly disrupting the day to day operations of the organisations using the platform.  </p>

<p>The contract was then renegotiated for a further six months to polish the user interfaces and improve the user experience. I worked closely with users, managing AB experiments, user observation, and surveying. Continuous integration and tests using Travis, RSpec and Cucumber.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="software-engineer-task-specific-software-solutions-ts3">Software Engineer, Task Specific Software Solutions (TS3)</h4>
<p><em>November 2013 - July 2014</em></p>

<p>TS3 develops bespoke operations software for large enterprise clients including airports, mining operations and industrial production companies. They do everything in .NET.
At TS3 I worked in a team of three developers. My work was remote and I used Lync and Sharepoint for communications. I was exposed to many new technologies, and really enjoyed the opportunities to research and develop complex technical solutions suitable for the more challenging problems. I’ve included synopsis of the projects I worked on below.</p>

<p><strong>LUIS</strong> - Linked User Interface Suite</p>

<p>LUIS is an UI framework developed by TS3, it serves as the foundation of the user interface layer for many of their client’s solutions. Its purpose is to enable rapid development of systems which connect analytics, forms, and integrated machinery for business management to have oversight of operations in multiple work sites.</p>

<p>Prior to my employment LUIS was restricted to .NET Framework 2.0 and WinForms, which limited its ability to integrate with the latest technologies. I initiated a project to redevelop LUIS in .NET Framework 4 and WPF, this allowed for greater compatibility with client systems and the latest hardware and reduced development time of new projects. The project was lead by the CTO who had developed the original LUIS system. The integral components which I was responsible for was the initial research and case for how the project would significantly benefit TS3, and then in developing the user interface layer and backwards compatibility for legacy applications.</p>

<p><strong>ETU</strong> - Explosive Testing Unit for Airports</p>

<p>ETU replaced paper based systems used at airport gates to document the explosive testing processes. I was responsible for developing the mobile app for Windows Tablet and the API they communicated with.</p>

<p><strong>Delivery routing system</strong></p>

<p>An industrial baker in Australia delivers to many locations daily with ~10 trucks in the field at anytime. Our solution would replace a physical map and “best guess” method by integrating with their stock and ordering system (Hamilton Grant) and working out the optimal amount of trucks to put into the field, what stock they should take with them, where to deliver which stock, and which route they should follow.</p>

<p>I was responsible for developing a C# SDK to integrate with ArcGIS to do the routing, integrating with Hamilton Grant, and also the Windows mobile application for delivery drivers which tracked their physical progress, allowed for data input to track crates, and also deal with those inevitable unexpected last minute changes which come up in the field.</p>

<p>Previously all projects at TS3 were done solely in T-SQL and stored procedures. I introduced TS3 to Entity Framework for a portion of this project with excellent results.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<hr />

<h4 id="technical-lead-digital-stock">Technical Lead, Digital Stock</h4>
<p><em>November 2011 - November 2013</em></p>

<p>I started Digital Stock with Avinash Varghese in 2011 while I was studying at the Southern Institute of Technology. We offered websites and online marketing services to local businesses. I provided the technical expertise to create our customer’s solutions and Avinash offered business experience and strong social networks to leverage sales.
 My purpose in founding Digital Stock was to gain industry experience and also make that opportunity available to other students. In 2012 we hired two of my classmates Jim Dowling and Will Finlayson. When I graduated I wanted to grow my skills and career by working under more senior developers, and as I left those two purchased my shares and became directors.  Digital Stock evolved rapidly and is now a busy development consultancy specialising in farming solutions. I am extremely proud that Digital Stock maintains a close relationship with the Southern Institute of Technology by continuing to offer industry experience to students through internships.</p>

<h4 id="bachelor-of-information-technology-southern-institute-of-technology">Bachelor of Information Technology, Southern Institute of Technology</h4>
<p><em>Graduated 2013, A- average, transcript available on request</em></p>

<p>Papers focused programming, human computer interactions and system analysis and design. I was exposed to a wide range of technologies, worked on real projects for local businesses, and developed a broad foundational knowledge of Information Technologies. I entered every programming competition I could, and regularly placed first within the institute.</p>

<p>Distinctions include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>2nd place ACM-ICPC division, 2011</li>
  <li>Top marking student, 2011</li>
  <li>Class Respresentative, 2012</li>
  <li>Best Project, 2013</li>

<h3 id="background-hobbies-etc">Background, hobbies, etc.</h3>

<p>I am from Auckland, New Zealand. However I’ve been a US permanent resident since 1999. I’ve lived in Hawaii, Oregon and Washington at different times in my life. In 2010 I moved back to NZ to study and after graduation I enjoyed working on tech startups in Wellington (tech and political capital of NZ). I’m unmarried, really like dogs and cats, and I have four siblings. I read a huge amount of books on a wide range of topics and am always coming up with whacky ideas.</p>
