I have recently relocated to Vancouver, WA from Wellington, New Zealand. I'm a web developer and a US resident. I have loads of experience in pre-money startups and love working on awesome products.

Right now I am looking for a permanent position working with other talented developers, with great benefits and a fair salary. I am proud of my work and enjoy a diverse and supportive working environment. I offer a cando attitude, broad knowledge of web development, and am generally a great guy to have around.
