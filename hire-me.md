I have recently relocated to Vancouver/Portland area from Wellington, New Zealand. I'm a web developer and a US resident. I have loads of experience in pre-money startups and love working on awesome products.

Ideally I am looking for a permanent position working with developers of greater and lesser experience*, with great benefits and a fair salary. I am proud of my work and enjoy a diverse and supportive work environment. I offer a cando attitude, broad knowledge of web development, and promise to be a generally pleasant guy to have around.
