I'm from New Zealand, but I live in Vancouver, WA now. This is my personal site, where I indulge in writing about myself and my ideas. It's mostly about my efforts to make great stuff, from how my code works to how we as people work together. I also like to make note of good books I've read and why I liked them.

Right now I work at HP Inc. on Instant Ink as a web developer, using Rails, React.js and a host of other great technologies. Even though we're a part of a big company, we borrow lots of ideas and methods from successful tech startups. <em>This websites contains only my own opinions and thoughts (unless otherwise attributed), do not think for a second that anything I say represents my employer.</em>

Before Instant Ink, I founded and worked in a handful of other startups in tiny teams on shoe string budgets. Some of them were more successful than others, but all of them offered awesome learning which left me with a passion for product development.
