I'm a **software developer** in ~~Invercargill~~, ~~Wellington~~, ~~Portland~~, **Santa Barbara**.

Anything found here in no way represents the views of my employer, [Procore Technologies](https://www.procore.com/) _(who is totally rad - talk to me if you want the best job you'll ever have)_.

I've founded and worked on a handful of shoestringed startups, some of them were more successful than others. All of them offering awesome learnings and imbuing me with a passion for product development which I will attempt to relate herein.
