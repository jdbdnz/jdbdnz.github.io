The contract commenced at approximately the same time Leaping Tiger launched its initial systems which were developed at Touchtech.

Touchtech’s contract ended December 2015, at which time Leaping Tiger offered me a permanent position as their CTO. I declined the position as it required my presence in NZ, whereas I had planned to reside in the USA from 2016. For the purpose of performing proper hand over to the new CTO, I have accepted a remote contract with Leaping Tiger which ends in March 2016.

- Mailchimp
- Google Analytics

#### Responsibilities

- Creation and curation of technical documentation

#### Software Engineer, Task Specific Software Solutions (TS3)
***November 2013 - July 2014***

TS3 is an Australian based company which develops bespoke operational software for enterprise clients, most notable of which are airports, mining operations and industrial production companies. They use Microsoft technologies wherever possible. 

#### Role Purpose

Working remotely in a team of three developers, reporting directly to the COO. Perform planning, analysis, design, and development of solutions as directed.
Technologies

- WinForms
- WPF
- Windows Mobile
- Office 365, Lync, SharePoint
- MSSQL, stored procedures, replication
- MVC.NET
- ArcGIS
- C#

#### Responsibilities

- Research and Development
- UI/UX Design
- System Architecture
- Developing, deploying, and supporting solutions for clients
Achievements
- Initiated, researched and developed .NET Framework 4.0 replacement for TS3’s proprietary user interface framework ‘LUIS’ which was previously limited to .NET Framework 2.0. This enabled interoperation with modern .NET technologies, most notably Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). This allowed responsive user interfaces to be developed, solving a major pain point for clients who were running solutions with interfaces designed for 4:3 aspect ratio monitors, but had since upgraded to widescreen monitors
- Developed legacy support for the new LUIS 4.0, essentially making WPF act as a wrapper to run the WinForms solutions developed for LUIS 2.0. This enabled TS3 to discontinue support for LUIS 2.0 while still continuing support for those solutions developed for LUIS 2.0, whose owners did not want to update their interfaces from WinForms to WPF
- Developed C# SDK for integration with ArcGIS routing system


#### Technical Lead, Digital Stock
***November 2011 - November 2013***

I started Digital Stock with Avinash Varghese in 2011 while I was studying at the Southern Institute of Technology. We offered CMS websites and online marketing services to local businesses. I provided the technical expertise and Avinash offered business experience and strong social networks to leverage sales. 

My purpose in founding Digital Stock was to gain industry experience and also make that opportunity available to other students. In 2012 we hired two of my classmates Jim Dowling and Will Finlayson. When I graduated I wanted to grow my skills and career by working under more senior developers, and as I left those two purchased my shares and became directors.
Digital Stock evolved rapidly and is now a busy development consultancy specializing in farming technology. I am extremely proud that Digital Stock maintains a close relationship with the Southern Institute of Technology by continuing to offer industry experience to students through internships.

#### Role Purpose

- Excellent customer satisfaction
- Employed two part-time workers in second year of operation


### Background, etc.

I am from Auckland, New Zealand. However, I’ve been a US permanent resident since 1999I’ve lived in Hawaii, Oregon and Washington at different times in my life. In 2010 I moved back to NZ to study and after graduation I enjoyed working on tech startups in Wellington (tech and political capital of NZ).
